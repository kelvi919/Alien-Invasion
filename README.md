# Alien-Invasion ðŸš€
Using this Pygame-created project, I'm coding along with the book "Python crash course 2nd.".
Published by Nostrach Press as an introduction to Python and the Pygame module.

The game is based on a space shooter in which you control a ship shooting at aliens that try 
To get away from you or attack you.
